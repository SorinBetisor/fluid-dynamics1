This is a standart run (with no parallelization or hpc techniques whatsoever), with the config:

# Fluid Dynamics Simulation Configuration File
# Lines starting with # or ; are comments
# Format: parameter_name = value

# ===== Physical Parameters =====
# Reynolds number - controls the flow regime
Re = 1000.0

# Domain dimensions
Lx = 1
Ly = 1

# ===== Numerical Parameters =====
# Grid resolution
nx = 64
ny = 64

# Time stepping
dt = 0.005
tf = 20.0

# Stability and solver parameters
max_co = 1.0
order = 6

# Poisson equation solver settings
poisson_max_it = 10000
poisson_tol = 1E-3
poisson_type = 2

# Output settings
output_interval = 10

# ===== Boundary Conditions =====
# Internal field initial values
ui = 0.0
vi = 0.0

# Velocity boundary conditions
# u1 = right boundary, u2 = left boundary
# u3 = bottom boundary, u4 = top boundary
u1 = 0.0
u2 = 0.0
u3 = 0.0
u4 = 1.0

# v boundary conditions
v1 = 0.0
v2 = 0.0
v3 = 0.0
v4 = 0.0 

This is computing only vorticity.
